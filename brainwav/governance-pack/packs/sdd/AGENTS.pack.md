# SDD Pack

This pack enables spec-driven development. Required artifacts live in `specs/<slug>/` and are owned by the project.

## Required artifacts
- `specs/<slug>/spec.md`
- `specs/<slug>/plan.md`
- `specs/<slug>/tasks.md`

## Notes
- Tasks should reference evidence folders under `tasks/<task-id>/`.
- Keep specs user-owned; governance only updates templates.
